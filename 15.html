   Right as everyone was leaving or setting up camp,<br>
    Ferryman Charn calls out to everyone saying,<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"To those who plan on going into the Spirit Forest,<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  it is home to many spirits including the Anxes,<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  you must be vigilant and avoid interacting with the spirits or else they'll consume you."<br><br>

    You recover for the night, and wake up well rested.<br><br>
    Keeping the ferryman's warning in mind you begin your journey into the Spirit Forest.<br><br><br><br>
