    Evenutally you make it to the other side of the river, and get off the boat.<br>
     You look back at the boat to see ferryman Charn take off his captain's hat, and hold it to his chest and say, <br>
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“I’ve seen far too many men taken by the Anx, they be some overwhelming spirits.""<br><br>
     It is night time do you sleep and recover from the river, or push forward into the Spirit Forest to save time?<br><br><br>
