<h1>I know that life is hard right now for you, but know that I am so happy you are in my life,<br>
    You absolutely belong in grad school, if you didn't you would have quit after your first semester.<br>
    I know you can get through this, i'm sure there will be more obstacles to come, but you already have<br>
    overcome so many up until this point. I know you will be able to do it.<br>
    I am so proud of your progress, going for a doctorate is not something many people can do.<br><br>


    <b>I love you</b>
