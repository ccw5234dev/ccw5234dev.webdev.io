    Instead of panicking and wiping your body clean, you just observe it.<br>
     You don’t feel in any immediate danger, however some thought in the back of your head is saying to wipe yourself clean, <br>
     but it’s faint enough to not warrant any action so you ignore it, and continue walking. <br>
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEvery step forward you feel your feet planting the ground less and less. <br>
     You also notice your mind is losing focus, but no solution is coming to mind on how to remedy it. <br>
     All you know is you have to keep walking up the mountain.<br><br><br>
