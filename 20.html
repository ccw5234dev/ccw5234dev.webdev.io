    After calming your thoughts, you continue on your ascension to the top of the mountain. <br>
    All of a sudden, you start feeling pulses coming from behind you that reverberate throughout your body each time causing weariness.<br>
     Having experienced the anx’s call you recognize right away they’re hunting you. <br>
     You look behind to see if you can spot them, but the foliage of the forest is making it hard to see anything. <br>
     You decide its best to continue walking.<br><br><br>
