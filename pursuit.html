    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<h4>You are a new recruit in the Vita kingdomâ€™s military, your superiors tasked you with the mission of bringing a package to Suss Fal base,<br>
   the nicest military base in the country that all new recruits wish to be deployed.<br>
  You absolutely need to deliver this package; the lives of your comrades may depend on it.
  <br>
  However, your superiors failed to give you specific directions to get to Suss Fal other than the relative direction and 2 natural landmarks to help guide your way.
<br>
  The first natural landmark is the DeciDin River, a mystical river with a dense fog that lingers above it enveloping anything that it embraces.
<br>
  The second natural landmark is the Spirit Forest, a forest that contains a wide variety of spirits that usually are docile during the day, but more aggressive at night.
