You wake up the next morning, and see that there are other couriers around you,<br>
along with what looks like a ferryman offering to take the couriers across.<br>
Right before everyone gets on the boat, he warns everyone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beware of the Anx, they are spirits that use the river as one of their feeding grounds.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hunt by weakening their prey through the calls that they make."
<br><br><br>
You get on the boat with the others.
