      <h4>
    You continue to make your way up the mountain in the Spirit Forest, <br>
     you wished there was an easier way, but this is the only way you know.<br>
     Suddenly you hear a noise behind you. You look back and spot a couple couriers proceeding up the path as well.<br>
      You watch silently as they pass by with determined and experienced faces.<br>
       A little feeling in your stomach starts to bubble up, you begin to worry if you’ll ever get to be like them.<br><br>
        Thoughts of doubt and insecurity start forming. You want to greet them and ask for advice to get through the forest,<br>
         but they’re too busy on their own mission to help a rookie out. All you can do is watch in silence as they go out of sight.<br><br><br>
