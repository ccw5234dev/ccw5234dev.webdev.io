    After 10 minutes of walking up the mountain.<br> The anxs' effect on you is slowly diminishing,
     and your body is gaining its strength back. <br>
     Relief flows through your body and you unclench your fists after being tensed up while trying to escape the anxâ€™s call. <br>
     You look at your unclenched hands and notice something peculiar. <br>
     You clench your hands again, and realize you are losing slight feeling in your hands. <br>
     You take a closer look and see that near your wrist, there are tiny translucent gelatinous blobs. <br>
     <br><br><br>
     You wipe the blobs off and continue on.
