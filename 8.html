    You took your time and eventually made it to the DeciDin River a couple hours later.<br> However, it is night time now, all the couriers are long gone, it looks like they made it across the river.<br>
    You look over and notice that there is a rowboat resting on the bank of the river.<br><br><br>

    <a href="deadRiver.html">Take the rowboat across the river.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
