    The figure runs up to you, it’s another courier. They scan you up and down, <br>
    and then start swiping away at the accumulating blobs on your body. <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“It’s a good thing I came across you, you seemed to have encountered the desprin sprits. <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThey’re nasty little parasitic blob spirits that attach themselves to a lot of the couriers that pass through this forest.”<br>
    Your thoughts and senses slowly return, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Here you should take this repellant, it takes a little bit for it to work, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is quite effective against the desprins.”<br><br><br>
