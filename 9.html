    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe ferryman pushes off the river bank and you all propel into the fog. <br>
    The further you go into the fog the more visibility drops. <br>
    you begin to feel like the fog is pushing on your skin and the pressure only increases the longer time passes,<br>
    your heart rate is increasing over time, and you begin to feel tired. <br>
    Your weariness continually increases, you feel as if something is calling you to the water. <br>
    Ferryman Charn calls out to everyone not to answer the Anxâ€™s call.<br><br><br>

It is becoming harder to resist your weariness as the call grows louder.<br><br><br>
