      <h4>
    You start speculating about what the blobs were.<br>
     They looked and felt different from sweat, what could they have been?<br>
      An itch inside your nose swells, causing you to sneeze into your arm. You wipe your nose with the back of your hand and continue walking, <br>
     but then 2 questions pop into your head,<br>
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“Why didn’t I feel my arm feel sneezing into it, and why did I not feel my hand against my face while wiping my nose?” <br>
     You examine your arm to see blotches of the translucent blobs all over it.<br>
      You immediately stop and start to inspect your whole body and find the translucent blobs scattered throughout your limbs and back.<br><br><br>
