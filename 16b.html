    After walking on a dirt path for 10 minutes, you notice that you’re beginning to lose feeling throughout your body,<br>
     it’s becoming harder and harder to walk. You also notice the same increased heartbeat and weariness you felt while traversing the DeciDin river.<br>
     You realize it’s the Anx’s call again, <br><br><br>

     What do you do?
